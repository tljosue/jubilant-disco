# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub. This collection of guides centralizes our project management practices and serves as the starting point for understanding how we plan, execute, and deliver successful projects.

## About Our Approach

OctoAcme's project management methodology is built on an **iterative, customer-first approach** that emphasizes continuous delivery, clear communication, and team empowerment. Our processes are designed to help teams deliver high-quality outcomes while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to change.

### Core Principles

Our project management practices are guided by four foundational principles:

- **Customer-first value**: We prioritize customer needs and usability in every decision, ensuring our work delivers real value.
- **Iterative delivery**: We work in small, testable increments that can be validated and adjusted based on feedback and evidence.
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles and responsibilities, with named Project Managers and Product Leads accountable for outcomes.
- **Psychological safety**: We foster an environment where team members feel empowered to share feedback, raise concerns, and learn from both successes and setbacks.

### Our Workflow

Projects at OctoAcme move through a structured lifecycle that balances planning with flexibility:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem, identify stakeholders, establish success criteria, and create a high-level timeline.
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, and align on delivery timelines.
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, and review iteratively with regular standups, demos, and progress tracking.
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy features to production with proper testing, rollback plans, and stakeholder communication.
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements for future work.

### Roles & Responsibilities

Clear roles enable effective collaboration and accountability:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery schedules, manages risks and dependencies, facilitates communication, and ensures transparency across stakeholders.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes and success metrics, prioritizes the backlog, and measures impact based on customer value.
- **Developers**: Implement features to meet acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, and help identify technical risks.
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality standards, test acceptance criteria, and ensure features meet requirements before release.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals throughout the project lifecycle.

### Communication & Risk Management

Successful projects depend on frequent, transparent communication and proactive risk management:

- **Regular syncs**: Weekly PM-PdM alignment, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates
- **Risk management**: Continuous identification and mitigation of risks with clear ownership and documented plans
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact through metrics and iterate based on evidence
- **Escalation paths**: Structured processes for addressing blockers at appropriate levels
